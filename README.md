# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator-Project
This project implements an Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) using Data Structures and Algorithms, designed to perform arithmetic operations on very large numbers that exceed the limits of built-in data types.The calculator represents numbers using a Doubly Linked List, where each node stores a single digit.
